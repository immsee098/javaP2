The Road not Taken - Robert Frost


Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
¡¡
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,¡¡

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I ---
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.?? 


O Captain! My Captain! - by Walt Whitman 

 

I.
O CAPTAIN! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;  
The ship has weather¡¯d every rack, the prize we sought is won;  
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,  
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:  
But O heart! heart! heart!    
O the bleeding drops of red,  
Where on the deck my Captain lies,  
Fallen cold and dead.  

 

II.
O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;  
Rise up?for you the flag is flung?for you the bugle trills;  
For you bouquets and ribbon¡¯d wreaths?for you the shores a-crowding;  
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;  
Here Captain! dear father!  
This arm beneath your head;  
  It is some dream that on the deck,  
  You¡¯ve fallen cold and dead.  

III.      
My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;  
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will;
The ship is anchor¡¯d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done;  
From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object won;  
Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!  
But I, with mounful tread,  
Walk the deck my Captain lies,  

Fallen cold and dead.
